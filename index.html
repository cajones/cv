Video content was protected with PlayReady DRM and we had to work closely with Microsoft under NDA as early technology adopters. <br/> I was personally responsible for the technical delivery of the entire solution and worked with a team developers, designers and engineers to produce an amazing ecosystem of sites and services.

The system had to be robust and reliable and capable of delivering audio despite critical failure. The final installation ran on a pair of isolated server farms, each containing 160 blades. The system received metadata and live audio or uncompressed audio and output formats suitable for internet listeners.</td>
